            <h4> <br>Ideas have always excited me. The fact that we could dream something and bring it to life fascinates me. Computer Science provides me a window to do exactly that.<br>

 <br><b>Hi<br></b> I am Muhib Shaikh pursuing comp engg from DPCOE Pune. So i came to pune with a vision of becoming a good software engineer as i have heard from many people that pune is really a good city for students to learn and grow so that‚Äôs all what I wanted as a student. But the thing doesn't go well as we want them to. After getting admission in pune I felt limited to technical stuff because I got so dependent on my college as we all do and remain unaware of what really happens in IT industries.  I really wanted to know what kind of jobs do they do in IT industries.  To control my curiousness I shift my thoughts and keep on getting reminded by myself that ‚Äúfirst i should get a degree then I will think about it, it‚Äôs too early to know about all that IT industry stuff‚Äù.<br><br>

As the time passed my interest for tech stuff was fading away. But one day my college organized a seminar where some people from IT industry showed up. They shared their knowledge about new technologies, software etc. My interest got back up and felt motivated somehow but i don't know how to start and when. I really needed some guidance because that seminar was just for awareness about IT industries that it‚Äôs a tough competition out there to get a job. So I thought it would be better to start with basic programming languages like C and C++, and I am not much of a self learner so somehow i tried to learn these languages and got some basic idea but this was not enough.<br><br>

 So i thought why not I join some classes. And took admission in AAR ( Act. Achieve. Repeat.)institute, the instructor over here are from IT industries itself, now what else I want. So I am still learning here in AAR. They made us aware, showed us the path and they teach us in a professional way, the way  IT industries work. I didn't knew how to code in java or do any queries in SQL database or how to give presentation even a self introduction. Now you can't imagine the interest and passion I have now about technology and IT industries. But wait, not only this they also changed me from my personality to my technical skills. The main difference between this institute and other institute is that they got professional trainers straight from the IT industry and they give special attention to each and everyone doesn‚Äôt matter whether the student is a newbie or technically good they want to see everyone on the same pace, and on the top of that they also teach us soft skills which includes writing skills, presentation skills etc.. And i am still learning growing because of AAR. And before joining AAR I wasn't even aware of technical events that are organized in Pune.<br><br>


So they interacted me with some technical community like gdg and there was an event coming over at that time of gdg community of WomenTechMakers, it was my first technical event that i attended in pune and i was so excited and nervous to go there, nervous because i was all alone and on the top of that i got late. So as I entered the event I saw a lot of people and i didnt have any clue what was happening at that time. I was so hesitant to go and have a word with anyone there because i was an introvert. But, I tried and did things out of my comfort zone. It takes a lot of courage to do something that doesn‚Äôt lie in your comfort zone and talking to people was a big deal for me, but then I started to communicate with some people. At first I met a girl she was the event organizer and I introduced myself, then she asked did I have lunch or not, then she showed me the way to grab the lunch after having my lunch I joined the event.<br><br>

 So at that time there was a speech given by Aarti Nathan she is the COO of Media Magic Technologies, she shared her experience about the incredible products she had worked on, the amazing opportunities that she has been fortunate to have got and experiences with some turbulent times. After this there was session of Neha Nahar Technical expert at persistent, this session was about blockchains. Some of you might not have heard about what is blockchain is unless if you are not into technical stuff. So in short it can change the future of India you might be wondering how. So it‚Äôs quite a long topic to describe it here just wait for my another post I will describe it along with a java program and will share my github link.<br><br>

So now the last session was a competition about startup ideas that who ever got some great idea has to come on the stage and describe it. Many people shared their ideas and surprisingly one guy had same idea that i was carrying in my head so after that session I interacted with the guy and we decided to do a startup together in the future. That guy is in last year of engineering and got placed in a company so now I just can hope for the best for the start up thing.<br><br>

So this was all about this event which changed my perspective about technologies that it has no limitations and one last thing I want to add up is, technology gives you power which you can‚Äôt even imagine the only rule is you should know how to use it. And now I am looking forward to attend more technical events like this and keep on exploring learning and growing, because that‚Äôs all i want as a student üôÇ.
